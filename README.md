git clone --recursive https://github.com/v310r/LearnOpenGL.git -> to correctly clone the repo.

This repository is made only for learning purposes. Everything was taken from https://learnopengl.com/. 

If you'll find this useful, than I'd be glad. You might notice, that such copies already exist, but who cares :D. At least it'd be useful to me. 

Every branch of this repo corresponds to some chapter. Choose whatever you like or need.


Currently, only the windows platform is supported, but as time passes, additional platforms might be added :-).

Have a nice day :D.

P.S. to build the whole project, you'll need to firstly run CMake on glfw project. To do that you'll need to create vendor/glfw/build folder and run "cmake .." from there.

     Then run GenerateProject.bat. Next -> open LearnOpenGL solution and add glfm reference to the LearnOpenGL project.

     And now you should be ready to compile and run the program :D.
