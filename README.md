This repository is made only for learning purposes. Everything was taken from https://learnopengl.com/. 

If you'll find this useful, than I'd be glad. You might notice, that such copies already exist, but who cares :D. At least it'd be useful to me. 

chapters are located in folder "chapters" :D.


Only the windows platform is tested :-).

Have a nice day :D.

P.S. to build the whole project, you'll need to firstly run CMake on glfw project. To do that you'll need to create vendor/glfw/build folder and run "cmake .." from there.

     Then run GenerateProjects.bat you should be ready to compile and run the program :D.
