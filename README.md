This repository is made only for learning purposes. Everything was taken from https://learnopengl.com/. 

If you'll find this useful, than I'd be glad. You might notice, that such copies already exist, but who cares :D. At least it'd be useful to me. 

Every branch of this repo corresponds to some chapter. Choose whatever you like or need.


Currently, only the windows platform is supported, but as time pass, additional platforms might be added :-).

Have a nice day :D.
